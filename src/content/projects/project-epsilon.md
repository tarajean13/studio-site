## Overview

Cultivar produces small-batch natural wines with a focus on terroir and minimal intervention. We designed a label system that reflects their philosophy — honest, expressive, and rooted in the land.

## Approach

Each varietal gets its own illustrated landscape, rendered in a single ink color that corresponds to the wine's character. The illustration style is deliberately imperfect, echoing the handmade nature of natural winemaking.

## Deliverables

- Label design system for 12 varietals
- Custom illustrations for each wine
- Capsule and cork designs
- Shipping box design
- Tasting room collateral
- Brand guidelines

The label system has become a talking point in the natural wine community and has helped Cultivar expand distribution to 15 new markets.
