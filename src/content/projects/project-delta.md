## Overview

Noctis had been publishing for over a decade but their visual identity hadn't evolved with their editorial voice. We reimagined the magazine from cover to colophon, creating a design system that supports long-form journalism and visual essays.

## Approach

The redesign centers on a custom typographic system that gives each section of the magazine its own character while maintaining a cohesive identity. We developed a flexible grid that accommodates everything from dense text layouts to full-bleed photography.

## Deliverables

- Masthead redesign
- Custom typographic system
- Editorial grid templates
- Cover design system
- Digital edition design
- Style guide for contributors

The redesigned magazine received recognition from the Type Directors Club and saw a 28% increase in newsstand sales.
