## Overview

Atelier is a traveling exhibition that examines how traditional craft practices intersect with digital fabrication and emerging technologies. We created an identity system that bridges these two worlds.

## Approach

The identity is built on a generative design system — the logo and key visual elements are created through a custom algorithm that references traditional weaving patterns. Each city on the exhibition tour receives a unique variation of the identity.

## Deliverables

- Generative identity system
- Exhibition catalog design
- Promotional poster series
- Social media campaign
- Motion graphics for exhibition spaces
- Merchandise design

The identity has been featured in It's Nice That and Communication Arts, and the exhibition has traveled to six cities across three continents.
