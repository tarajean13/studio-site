## Overview

Forma needed a digital presence that matched the ambition of their built work. We designed and developed a website that uses bold typography, considered whitespace, and cinematic project presentations.

## Approach

The site architecture mirrors how Forma presents their work in person — starting with the big picture before revealing the carefully considered details. Scroll-driven animations bring the architectural photography to life.

## Key Features

- Full-screen project galleries with smooth transitions
- Custom cursor interactions on project imagery
- Responsive grid system that adapts to content density
- Performance-optimized image loading for large photo sets
- Integrated project filtering by typology and year

The site achieves a perfect balance between visual impact and usability, loading in under 2 seconds while delivering a rich, immersive experience.
