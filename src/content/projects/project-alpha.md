## Overview

Meridian approached us with the challenge of creating a brand that embodies tranquility, luxury, and the raw beauty of the Pacific Northwest landscape. The result is a visual identity rooted in natural forms and a muted, earthy palette.

## Approach

We began with an immersive research phase, spending time at the retreat location to understand the sensory experience. The brand mark draws from the convergence of mountain ridgelines and still water reflections.

## Deliverables

- Primary and secondary logomarks
- Brand guidelines document
- Stationery suite
- Signage and wayfinding system
- Digital asset library
- Photography art direction

The identity system was designed to be flexible yet cohesive, working seamlessly across digital touchpoints and physical materials. Each element reflects the retreat's commitment to mindful, intentional design.
