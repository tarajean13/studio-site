## Overview

Luminary wanted to create a meditation app that felt different from the crowded wellness space — less prescriptive, more exploratory. We designed an experience that adapts to the user's mood and available time.

## Approach

The interface strips away visual clutter, using generous whitespace and subtle animations to create a sense of calm before the user even begins a session. The color palette shifts throughout the day, responding to natural light cycles.

## Deliverables

- User research and persona development
- Information architecture
- Complete UI design system
- Interactive prototypes
- Motion design specifications
- Developer handoff documentation

The app launched to positive reviews, reaching the top 10 in the Health & Fitness category within its first month.
