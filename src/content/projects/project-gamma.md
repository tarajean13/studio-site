## Overview

We partnered with the audio team to craft a launch campaign that communicates the product's seamless integration into everyday life. The campaign spans digital, social, and out-of-home placements.

## Approach

Rather than focusing on technical specifications, we centered the campaign on moments of human connection — the shared experience of listening. The visual language uses soft, atmospheric photography paired with bold typographic statements.

## Deliverables

- Campaign concept and art direction
- Hero film (60s, 30s, 15s cuts)
- Social media content suite
- Out-of-home billboard designs
- Landing page design and development
- Email marketing templates

The campaign achieved a 340% increase in pre-orders compared to the previous product launch.
