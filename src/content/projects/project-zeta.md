## Overview

Verso is a 12-story mixed-use building that combines residential, retail, and co-working spaces. We designed an environmental graphics system that helps people navigate the building intuitively while reinforcing the development's identity.

## Approach

The system uses a combination of dimensional typography, painted murals, and subtle material changes to create a layered wayfinding experience. Each floor has a distinct color accent drawn from the building's architectural palette.

## Deliverables

- Wayfinding strategy and planning
- Signage design for all building zones
- Elevator and lobby environmental graphics
- Parking garage numbering system
- Directory and map design
- Fabrication specifications and oversight

The project was completed in collaboration with the building's architecture team, ensuring every graphic element feels integral to the space rather than applied.
