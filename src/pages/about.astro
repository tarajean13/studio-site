  <!-- Philosophy -->
  <section class="px-6 lg:px-12 max-w-7xl mx-auto pb-16 lg:pb-24">
    <div class="border-t border-border pt-16 lg:pt-24 max-w-2xl">
      <h2 class="text-sm uppercase tracking-wide text-muted mb-6">Philosophy</h2>
      <p class="text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We approach every project as a collaboration. Great work doesn't happen in a vacuum. It emerges from honest conversations, shared curiosity, and a willingness to explore unexpected directions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Our process is rooted in research and strategy, but we leave room for intuition and happy accidents. We believe that constraints breed creativity, and that the simplest solution is usually the strongest.
      </p>
      <p class="text-secondary leading-relaxed">
        We're not interested in trends for their own sake. Instead, we aim to create work that feels both contemporary and enduring, that grows more meaningful over time.
